# IFNmodeling
A collection of Python scripts for modelling cell signaling generally, and specifically interferon signaling.

This is primarily my working directory for exploring models of immune cell signaling. 
- Class files can be found in /ifnclass
- Scripts to produce figures for upcoming publication are in /ifnscripts with file names of the form figure_X.py where X is the figure from the draft paper
